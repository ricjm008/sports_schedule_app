## Description:
The sports scheduler app allows users to follow local sporting teams around them using a social media like approach. Instead of trying to find which league a team plays in, to be able to find where theyre playing next or how theyve been playing, with the sport scheduler app you can simply follow a team that you're interested in, and on your dashboard that team will appear. This allows users to not only keep tabs on their own sporting teams, but potentially on mates and friends teams and you can see how they've been playing/their team is going. This app was designed with all users in mind, and its simple nature makes it perfect for social sports aswell, with future functionality to create your own leagues and teams.
 
## Usage:
Create an account on the applications site, find a team and follow them!
